## üåç Ethical Considerations & Social Impact
### üîç Reflecting on Bias in Models and Data
We acknowledge that the data used to train and evaluate our models may carry inherent structural biases. In our dataset, many job positions already show a significant gender imbalance in application rates, particularly underrepresentation of women. This skew may cause predictive models to inadvertently learn and reinforce existing inequalities.

To mitigate this, we designed our bias_detector and inclusivity_scorer modules based on peer-reviewed research and descriptive linguistic heuristics. By relying on documented gendered language patterns rather than purely predictive labels, we aim to reduce overfitting to historical bias and instead promote equity-focused evaluation.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Recognizing Risks of Automated Language Rewriting
Although our intelligent rewriting tool is built to make job descriptions more inclusive, we recognize the potential risks associated with automatic language modification:

Semantic drift ‚Äì critical job requirements may be unintentionally softened or misrepresented;

New forms of bias ‚Äì replacing certain words might introduce gender-coded terms or cultural assumptions;

Contextual mismatch ‚Äì inclusive phrases, if overused or misplaced, may appear inauthentic or tokenistic.

We strongly recommend that the tool be used as a decision-support system, rather than a fully automated rewriting engine. Final revisions should always be reviewed and approved by human recruiters or hiring professionals.

### üö∫ Emphasizing Gender Inclusion as a Primary Goal
Numerous studies have shown that women remain underrepresented in STEM, technical, and leadership roles‚Äîpartly due to gender-coded language in job postings. Our dataset reflects this: approximately 60% of job ads in our sample received less than 30% female applicants.

Our core mission is to equip hiring teams with data-driven tools to detect and reduce unconscious bias in job descriptions, thereby making the hiring process more welcoming and equitable across gender lines. We hope our work contributes to building more inclusive workplaces, not just in AI but in the real-world decisions AI supports.
